So many ways to look at this situation! Here some of the options: 

- Men on the lookout: "I know I just saw this lion! Where is it !?"
- The lion: "Ok, another 2 minutes and it's time for lunch."
- The guy in passenger seat: "The boss will figure out where to go next..."


There is also one more observation to make:

- All 3 men on the look out are "looking" in the same direction -- who said groups are wiser than individuals?

                                                                 -
