First post! -- It's more than a decade into 21st century -- time to get a blog going. Who knows, I might even connect it to that "social" stuff.


At the same time, seems only now technology is catching up to a level that I would use for my own blog. That is to a level of appropriate simplicity/flexibility/... but I should defer details to a later post.
